# Code-Quiz

This is the homework for week four. The main objective is to develop a responsive application that challenges the user with a timed quiz. The questions are multiple-choice and revolve around javascript fundamentals. The questions will show after the user clicks start or selects an answer. The game is over after all the questions are answered or the timer reaches zero.
